The `scratch` branch holds the Neovim config I built from scratch, it is ugly and bare minimum of what I need. 
Tried using pre-built configs but they had too much stuff I didn't need. 
The organization of the code and the remaps can be a lot better/cleaner but I try not to play with my configs too much becuase 
usually one thing leads to another and I spend my entire week on it.
